{% endhint %}

Profile Picture (or) PFP is the first thing people upload when they start using Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat or whatever social media website out there. It dates back to the early internet age where people upload pictures of themselves to represent us on the internet.&#x20;

Profile Pictures is a representation of ourselves on the internet. We can post specific stuff on the internet to flex our wealth, beauty (or) whatever we are proud of. People start using filters, fake images (or) edited images to prove themselves great on the internet.

PFPs are profile pictures, but for people in cryptocurrency, it is an identity and a place to show off their wealth, character, & ability to the world.

#### How does NFT offer a clean solution?

Since the launch of [**crypto punks**](https://larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) in 2017, no one imaged that people would go crazy to buy them for millions of dollars. Yes, these millionaire PFPs are worth millions of dollars since they are verifiable on the blockchain.&#x20;

These punks are a representation of a person on the internet. If someone owns a punk, it is indirectly saying that he/she is worth millions of dollars. However, this time, we can verify it from a trusted source, the blockchain.

#### Are these PFPs worth it?

Are the Rolex watches & Gucci belts worth it? Yes, of course, they bring in the validation of who we are and what we are capable of. However, on the internet, it does not worth a penny.&#x20;

However, these NFT PFPs are valid on the _**metaverse**_, the upcoming universe where we all co-exist in the internet world.&#x20;

So all these NFTs are provided with full rights over the image, so if someone owns them, they can show the world that they are the real one who owns it. Each NFT has metadata, the information related to the NFTs and are stored on the decentralized filesystem called IPFS.
